# Depth_Chart_Tx-bit

This is a simple code that I will update in the future that enables users to create a simple depth chart using TXbit order book data. 

In this version, it is possible to filter according to prices and change the range if needed. This is so we don't see orders that may be out of the interest of the user. 
Python only, just need to get the right libraries. 

This is the current result for prices between 0.04 and 0.5 USD per ETI

Hopefully more is coming soon.
