# Depth_Chart_Xeggex

This is a simple code that I will update in the future that enables users to create a simple depth chart using Xeggex public order book data. 

It enables you to check the cost and price movement when buying a certain amount of ETI coins. 
It is possible to filter according to prices and change the range if needed. This is so we don't see orders that may be out of the interest of the user. 

Python only, just need to get the right libraries. 

This is the current result for prices between 0.035 and 1.5 USD and buying 10,000 ETI.

Hopefully more is coming soon.
