# Depth_Chart_Tx-bit

This is a simple code that I will update in the future that enables users to create a simple depth chart using TXbit order book data. 

In this version, it is possible to filter according to prices and change the range if needed. This is so we don't see orders that may be out of the interest of the user. 

Hopefully more coming soon.
